\chapter{Emissions}
	When dealing with the emissions there is a strong trade-off between global (greenhouse gases, ...) and local (health, NOx, ...) effects.
	
\section{Emission formation}
	The ideal combustion case is: 
	
	\begin{equation}
	C_x H_yO_z + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O
	\end{equation}
	
	We can see that $CO_2$ is the product of the combustion at the same level of the $H_2O$ and should not be considered as pollutant. But in reality what happens is: 
	
	\begin{equation}
	C_x H_y O_z + O_2 + N_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O + N_2 + O_2 + CO + C_xH_yO_z + C_mH_nO_o + NO + H_2
	\end{equation}
	
	However, the $CO_2$ contributes to the greenhouse effect when coupled in the atmosphere and its minimization is also important from an efficiency viewpoint. It is not the only greenhouse effect gas, the other have more consequent effects. \\
	
	Pollutants have several negative effects, for example: 
	\begin{itemize}	
	\item[•] $CO$ is very toxic (asphyxiation).
	\item[•] $NOx$ which combined with $HC$ and sunlight produces \textbf{ozone}. Ozone can lead to respiratory or cardiac problems. 
	\item[•] $NO + O_3 \rightarrow NO_2$ formation occurs very quickly. It leads to lung malfunctioning, acid rains $HNO_3$ and formation of Nitro-Pah (carcinogenic).\\
	\end{itemize}
	
	In fact the smaller the particle the more treatment it requires because it penetrates easily into lungs.

	Above we can see that SI and CI engines do not have the same emissions and we can also regroup all the parameters leading to emission in function of the equivalence ratio as shown on the plot. In SI engines, the important phenomenon leading to main emissions is the absorption of $HC$ by deposits and cylinder walls that free them at the emission point. 
	
\paragraph{CO}
	Carbon monoxide is mostly produced in SI engine when the fuel is rich ($\lambda > 1$) and is due to incomplete combustion. It is still present in lean fuels because of the dissociation reactions: 
	
	\begin{equation}
	CO + \frac{1}{2}O_2 \leftrightarrow CO_2 \qquad CO_2 + H_2 \leftrightarrow CO + H_2O
	\end{equation}
	
	that happen more easily in high temperature. It is thus possible to reduce it with combustion temperature decrease. 
	
\paragraph{NO} The $NO$ production mostly depends on the temperature, this is due to the kinematics of the reaction which shows a dramatic increase in production rate when above 1800 K. The equivalence ratio plays also a role since NO needs oxygen. The maximum is at $\lambda \approx 0.9$ since when higher, temperature increases but less oxygen and the contrary when $\lambda < 0.9$. It also needs times for production and thus is more present at low rpm. 

\paragraph{Unburned HC} The unburned hydrocarbons are mostly due to incomplete combustion. Other origins: "short circuit" between intake and exhaust valves, slow combustion or flame extinction, absorption desorption of fuel by oil, deposits or crevices. 

\paragraph{Soot} This emission is mostly due to not optimal combustion (ignition delay, speed) and is mostly observed in direct injection $\rightarrow$ CI, but also SI direct injection now. It increases dramatically in congested traffic and during idling. We remark also that SI engines produces PM. 

\section{Emission regulation}
	Emission legislation were implemented because of the concerns for the air quality and the impact on human health. From epidemiological studies, the upper limit before negative effects can be determined. Based on this limit and model on diffusion of pollutants, we can determine what is the limit on a global scale (country) and local scale. From these numbers and other assumptions, we can go back to the limit per source of pollutants, such as vehicles. \\
	
	Legislation differs from region to region, from the vehicle size, ... The difference between market is difficult with the manufacturer since he has to adapt the vehicle to each market, but they tend to harmonize. The legislation is based on $g/km$ emitted during a test cycle representative for real world driving (previously NEDC as project). 
	
\subsection{Chassis dyno cycle}
		\wrapfig{7}{l}{5}{0.25}{ch5/3}{ch5/3}
		The test are performed in a laboratory on a test bench. They are potentially non realistic but the legislators ask for durability of the results. But this is a way of harmonising the legislation as the tests are the same for everyone. To illustrate how dynamic a cycle is, we can plot for every second of the test what is the acceleration and speed of the vehicle. For NEDC, this is illustrated by small acceleration and a very simple pattern. For WLTC, the range of acceleration and speed is much bigger and variable. However, this is still a predictable cycle, which could be identified.
		
		\wrapfig{6}{l}{6}{0.25}{ch5/4}{ch5/4}
		The other problem of NEDC is that the entire operating map is not used. Here a comparison between Real Driving Emissions. It provides data with more insight and there is more random point on \autoref{ch5/3} (more difficult to cheat).
		
\subsection{Post-processing}
	As we have a lot of information we have to threat them. The first method is \textbf{EMROAD} (moving averageging window). The data is plotted on windows regarding their CO$_2$ accumulation, then we compute the average mg/km for all pollutants, then we find a value for the entire trip. \\
	
	The second method is \textbf{CLEAR} (Power Binning), the data is ranked in function of the instantaneous power bins. The post-processing is sensible to the windowing used. We use a setup to measure the dynamic profile of PM in GDI (gasoline direct injection), it relies on an impactor that can determine the number of particles of different sizes. 
	
\subsection{Cheating}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[•] Thermal window defeat device: temperature below the must for test
	\item[•] Hot restart defeat device: if engine already hot
	\item[•] Cycle detection defeat device: if we already know the cycle. \\
	\end{itemize}
	
	For the VW scandal for example, it is easy to prove cheating by change of emission strategy (cycle known). We only have to remake the cycle but backwards, the results should be very similar with non-cheating car. In the VW case they were 6 times higher than the legislation limit. 
	
\section{Emission reduction}
	There are many countermeasures for emissions. First in the input of the engine, we could change the fuel composition and lower the aromatics, but then RON decreases and thus lower efficiency. In the engine we could play with ignition time, ... and after engine, we could add catalysis. 

	\paragraph{NOx treatment}	
	NO production is reduced by playing on the temperature and the combustion time. Most of the time this results in a trade-off. For example, delaying the ignition timing decreases the peak temperature and NO but it also decreases the efficiency. Another often used method is the Exhaust Gas Recirculation, this consists in reinjecting part of the exhaust gases, so that the unburned fuel can burn and the inert gases makes the pressure and temperature lower in the combustion.\\
	
	\wrapfig{5}{l}{4}{0.3}{ch5/5}{ch5/5}	
	If previous solutions are not enough, we have to treat the exhaust gases. The strategies to reduce the pollutants will depend on the type of pollutant and the conditions in which they are produced ($\lambda$, T, ...). For example, $CO, HC$ and soot are oxidised to $CO_2$ and $NOx$ reduced to $N_2$, and the way to perform it differs with $\lambda$. 
	
\subsection{The three-way catalyst}
	\minifig{ch5/6}{ch5/7}{0.4}{0.4}{0.3}{0.3}
		
	The principle of the three-way catalyst is to use the synergy between the oxidation of HC and CO, and the reduction of NOx. To be effective, the catalyst should have a mixture of gases that stays very close to equivalence ratio 1, as shown in the figure. This is typically used in SI engines. For this the ECU measures the $\lambda$ and adjust the injection. This is a complex and expensive device: use of ceramic or metallic brick with holes and Pt, Rh, Pa catalytic material. \\
	
   \wrapfig{6}{l}{3.5}{0.3}{ch5/8}{ch5/8}	
   Reduction and oxidation processes have an activation temperature, thus this is a problem when cold start. We can use Electrically Heated Cat (EHC), combustion in exhaust or Close Coupled Cat (CCC). On the figure is plotted a \textbf{lambda sensor}, the principle consists in having one electrode in contact with air, another with exhaust and produce a voltage proportional to the $O_2$ difference. 
   
\paragraph{Disadvantages}
	There is a maximum sfc in for lean mixture and maximum power for rich mixture, but we want to stay at $\lambda = 1$. Pumping losses are higher because there is a backpressure from the device. There is a conflict between the exhaust temperature that must be high if we have efficiency and the conversion efficiency. Also between CO$_2$ production and emission limits. 
	
\subsection{Filtering}
	\minifig{ch5/9}{ch5/10}{0.4}{0.4}{0.49}{0.49}
	
	The filter principle consists in combining the pollutants with other material to make something better. Since the capacity of catalyst is limited, regeneration is needed. In the process of purification of PM for example, there is also a post-injection to increase the temperature of the exhaust to make the catalytic effect easier. It is possible to combine filtering and catalytic effect in continuously regenerating filters. \\
	
	As previous case, here are also some trade-off: the reduction of PM and PN is very important ($\approx - 98\%$) and it is very effective for nanoparticles, but back pressure and regeneration decrease efficiency. 
	
\subsection{After-treatment guarantee during life time of the vehicle}
	When cat ages, the light-off temperature increases, the retention capacity, conversion efficiency decreases and reactivity for different components varies. The aging is accelerated by catalyst poisons like sulphur, this is why we try to keep it minimal in the fuel.
